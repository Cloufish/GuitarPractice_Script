# GuitarPractice_Script


It is a script that automates manual stuff in the Guitar Practice Session.

This script though is from an amateur, and this Python automating script is one of the first project that the author (me) made.


### Practice divided to sections
The Practice areas are broke down into:
- Technique - development of right hand and left-hand strength and dexterity.

- Repertoire - learning songs and pieces.

- Transcribing - using your ears to work out songs and solos.

- Knowledge - new things: techniques, concepts, theory, scales, arpeggios, etc.

- Improvisation - if applicable gets added to the end of the routine.

The idea is borrowed from Justin - You can check out his article here -> ![Intermediate-Practice-Routine](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/intermediate-practice-routine-pc-502)

## Requirements:

- Python Selenium package version: >=4.0
- Transcribe - the software that helps to transcribe pre-downloaded piece of music

## TODO

[] Add the Exception Handling with Try/Except block in functions
